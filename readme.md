# Notes
Notes is a tiny application that is used to create, manage, and store notes in a common place. I found
that I was constantly creating quick little notes here and there using nano but they would get lost
in whatever deep directory I was in, this is a fix for that.

## Installation
run `bash install.sh` as root

## Usage
`notes -h`
